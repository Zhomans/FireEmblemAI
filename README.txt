Welcome to our Fire Emblem AI. We are Together We Ride (Jazmin Gonzalez-Rivero, Zach Homans, Elizabeth Mahon, and Brendan Ritter). We have created a simplified version of Fire Emblem, along with three enemy AI agents to fight against.

There are three runnable files: playable_test.py, bigger_test.py, and comVcomTest. To run, simply run "python <filename>".

playable_test.py features a small map, with a small number of player units and small number of enemy units.

bigger_test.py features a larger map with numerous player and enemy units.

comVcomTest.py pits the Aggressive agent against the Tricky agent and outputs the victor. Player 1 is the aggressive agent, Player 2 is the Tricky agent.

Instructions to play playable_test.py and bigger_test.py appear within the game itself.
